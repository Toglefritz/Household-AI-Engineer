# Dwellware Dashboard

A revolutionary macOS desktop application that makes creating custom household applications as easy as having a conversation. Built with Flutter, Dwellware Dashboard provides an intuitive interface for managing your household's digital tools through natural language interaction.

## Overview

Dwellware transforms is a personal development environment where you can create custom applications without any technical knowledge. Through a conversational interface, you describe the tools you need, and the system handles everything from requirements gathering to deployment.

**Key Features:**
- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language Interface** - Describe your needs in plain English
- üì± **Native macOS App** - Beautiful Flutter desktop interface
- üîí **Sandboxed Applications** - Each app runs independently and securely
- üîÑ **Iterative Development** - Refine and modify apps through conversation
- ‚ö° **Real-time Progress** - Watch your applications being built live

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main components working together:

### 1. Flutter Desktop Dashboard
Your main interface for managing applications:

- Grid view of all your custom applications
- Conversational interface for requesting new apps
- Real-time development progress monitoring
- One-click application launching

### 2. Orchestrator Backend
The intelligent coordination layer that:

- Processes natural language requests into technical specifications
- Manages Amazon Kiro development sessions
- Handles application deployment and containerization
- Provides real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Maintains application metadata and version control

### 3. AI Development Engine (Amazon Kiro)
Automated development capabilities:

- Generates code, tests, and documentation from specifications
- Iteratively refines implementations until quality standards are met
- Follows predefined templates and coding policies
- Outputs complete application artifacts

### 4. Application Isolation System
Ensures security and stability:

- Each application runs independently
- Isolated file system and network access per application
- Changes to the codebase for one application do not affect any of the other applications
